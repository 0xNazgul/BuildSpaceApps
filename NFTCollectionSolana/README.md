# **Buildspace Solana NFT Drop Project**
This is a NFT collection Drop on the Solana Network. I would **HIGHLY** recommand going through buildspace tutorial for the setup on this one it is pretty extensive.

## **Getting Started**
1. Set up a local Solana keypair
```sh
solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/devnet.json
```

2. Set this keypair as our default keypair check your local balance and then get some SOL
```sh
solana config set --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json

solana balance

solana airdrop 2
```

3. Add the pictures you wish to be minted to assets. Along with creating a json file(see mine for base example)
* If you'd want to add more or do less, make changes to the config file.

4. Upload NFTs and double check that they did
```sh
ts-node ~/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts upload -e devnet -k ~/.config/solana/devnet.json -cp config.json ./assets

ts-node ~/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts verify_upload -e devnet -k ~/.config/solana/devnet.json

```

5. Update the config.json file via:
```sh
ts-node ~/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts update_candy_machine -e devnet -k ~/.config/solana/devnet.json -cp config.json
```


6. Any changes you make along the way you'll have to go through these steps each time(SO DON"T MAKE MISTAKES):
    1. Delete the .cache folder that was generated by the Metaplex CLI's candy machine commands.
    2. Change up your NFT files to be whatever you want!
    3. Run Metaplex's upload command via the CLI to upload the NFTs and create a new candy machine.
    4. Run Metaplex's verify command via the CLI to make sure the NFTs were uploaded and the candy machine was properly configured.
    5. Update your .env file with the new address.
    6. Update time of drop via config and in run(folder path might change based on where you installed the candy machine):
    ```sh
    ts-node ~/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts update_candy_machine -e devnet  -k ~/.config/solana/devnet.json -cp config.json
    ```
